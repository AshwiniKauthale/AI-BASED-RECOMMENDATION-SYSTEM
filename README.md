# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS:

A Recommendation System is an algorithm designed to suggest items or content to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or the preferences of similar users. Recommendation systems are widely used in industries such as e-commerce (for product recommendations), music streaming services (for song recommendations), and movie streaming platforms (for movie recommendations). In this project, we will build a recommendation engine using Java and the Apache Mahout library, which is a popular machine learning library for scalable data mining and collaborative filtering.


Apache Mahout:
Apache Mahout is a machine learning library that provides algorithms for clustering, classification, and collaborative filtering. In this program, we’ll use Mahout’s collaborative filtering features to create a recommendation engine. Specifically, we’ll be using Mahout's SlopeOneRecommender, which is a collaborative filtering algorithm based on the Slope One method. This method is efficient and works well for recommending products or content to users based on the ratings or preferences of similar users.

Maven:
Maven is used as a build automation tool for managing project dependencies and creating the project structure. In this project, Maven will help us manage the Apache Mahout library, as well as any other dependencies needed for the program.

Sample Data (CSV Format):
The program relies on a dataset of user-item ratings, stored in a ratings.csv file. This file contains ratings provided by users for various products or content. The format typically consists of three columns: user ID, item ID, and rating. The recommendation engine will use this data to generate predictions for items that users may like based on similar users’ preferences.

Class: org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.recommender.SlopeOneRecommender

Features: Collaborative filtering based on Slope One algorithm, which is particularly effective for large datasets with a sparse matrix of user-item interactions.

Apache Commons Collections is a library that provides additional collections-related functionality, such as working with lists and maps. This is useful in our program when managing the list of recommended items generated by the Mahout recommender.
Plugin: org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin (to compile the project) and org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin (for running tests)
